# NoteTaker

The NoteTaker is an express application that stores your notes to a local JSON file, allowing you to manage all your notes. 

To begin, click the Start button on the main page. On the next page, the user can create a new note by typing into the Note Title and Note Text fields. The user can then click the Save button to store the note, which then moves to left side of the screen. This area can be scrolled once the user saves mutliple notes.

To view a saved note, the user simpy clicks on the Title or Text of a note in the list and the note is expanded in the main viewing area.

Saved notes can be removed by clicking the "delete" button attached to every note. Please note that the current delete functionality is slow. Only one note can be deleted at a time and the user must refresh the page after clicking delete. Fix will be implemented soon.
